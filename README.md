# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Hospital Transport SaaS (Software-as-a-Service)

Welcome to the Hospital Transport SaaS project! This repository contains the source code for both the app and web application designed to facilitate non-urgent transport services to and from hospitals. The app provides drivers with an interface to view their scheduled trips and relevant information, while the web application allows dispatchers to manage trip requests, assign drivers, and monitor their locations in real-time on a Leaflet map.
Features

    Driver App: The mobile application for drivers to access their trip details, including pickup/drop-off locations, passenger information, and any additional instructions.
    Web Application: A web-based interface for dispatchers to manage trip requests, assign drivers, and track their locations using a Leaflet map.
    Trip Management: Dispatchers can plan trips for individuals who request transport by entering the necessary details, such as pickup/drop-off locations, date, time, and passenger information.
    Driver Assignment: Dispatchers can assign trips to available drivers based on their availability, proximity to the pickup location, and other relevant factors.
    Real-Time Tracking: The web application provides dispatchers with the ability to track drivers' locations in real-time on a Leaflet map, ensuring efficient management and monitoring of ongoing trips.
    Information Sync: The app and web application synchronize trip data, ensuring that drivers have the most up-to-date information about their assigned trips.
